A dialect of Joy in Python.


Joy is a programming language created by Manfred von Thun that is easy to
use and understand and has many other nice properties.  This Python script
is an interpreter for a dialect of Joy that attempts to stay very close
to the spirit of Joy but does not precisely match the behaviour of the
original version(s) written in C.  A Tkinter GUI is provided as well.

§ joy()

The basic joy() function is quite straightforward.  It iterates through a
sequence of terms which are either literals (strings, numbers, sequences)
or functions.  Literals are put onto the stack and functions are
executed.

Every Joy function is an unary mapping from stacks to stacks.  Even
literals are considered to be functions that accept a stack and return a
new stack with the literal value on top.
