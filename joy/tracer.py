'''

Machinery for tracing the execution of an expression.

You can ignore this for now.  It's not central to the Joy language and
it more properly should appear lower down in this script, however it is
used as a decorator for the joy() function and therefore must be in scope
when that function is declared (immediately below.)

class Tracer(object):
  '''
  Wrap the joy() function in an object that keeps track of the execution
  trace of the interpreter.  This trace datastructure contains each stack
  and expression that the joy() function has run during the execution of
  some expression, and it can be useful for exploring and re-running.

  Note that the frame attribute is accumulating the actual stack and
  expression tuples not copies or records.  You can pass these to joy()
  to rerun that expression on that stack.
