There is nothing and something, and something around itself is nothing again:

Nothing:

Something: []

Nothing again: [[]]

Do these in a row or file and it's a "bit" pattern: [] [[]] [] [[]] []

We can "count" using the bits as binary digits, so there numbers for you.

Successor function.  Counting. Addition, Multiplication, Subtraction -&gt; negatives,
Division -&gt; reals, Pairs -&gt; rationals &amp; complex numbers.

Logic, Math

Algorithms are sequence (dependency in time order), concurrent (non-interfering, simultaneous), branch (different Universes)

THAT'S IT.
