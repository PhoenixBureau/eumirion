  The cleave combinator expects two quotations, and below that an item X.
  It first executes [P], with X on top, and saves the top result element.
  Then it executes [Q], again with X, and saves the top result.
  Finally it restores the stack to what it was below X and pushes the two
  results P(X) and Q(X).
