Since we are storing history in git it makes sense to provide some sort of interface to it.  Linking to past versions of pages is one thing that leaps out.  Permitting the user to visit past versions of the server and either proceed from there (saved games) or cherry pick page data from the past into the current server.  (More generally there should be ways to build up new servers from data from other servers, whether those are completely different or just past versions of the "target" server.)
