Last May (2015) on Free Comicbooks Day I began collecting comicbooks.

I never did as a kid, although I had a subscription to "West Coast Avengers" for a little while, a gift from a relative.  Modern comics are not like the superhero stuff you might remember (although there is still plenty of that.)

Movies are all comics these days, while all the cool movie ideas appear in the comicbooks.  I'm going to write up reviews of the comics I have found that I really like. YMMV.
