If you render the stack into the page and create a command that puts a css: action onto the stack, then that CSS will take effect.  Try it: command:/01010101/00000041

Click to stop the animation by removing the css: action from the page stack. command:/01010101/00000035
stackinto:/00171000/00000005

You can't see the css: page action from the stackinto: page action because it is not rendered as text but as a CSS <style> element, so I've included a stack: page action here so you can see that the text containing the css: page action is, indeed, on this page's stack (a.k.a. the "joy" expression.)

stack:/00171000/00000005
css:/12345678/00000008
