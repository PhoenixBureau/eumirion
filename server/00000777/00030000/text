  There's a rich deep history behind all this but I don't care.  You go read that if you want to, it's awesome, as far as this goes here today you just learn you these things now.

There is nothing and something, and something around itself is nothing again:

Nothing:

Something: []

Nothing again: [[]]

Do these in a row or file and it's a "bit" pattern: [] [[]] [] [[]] []

We can "count" using the bits as binary digits, so there numbers for you.

Successor function.  Counting. Addition, Multiplication, Subtraction -> negatives,
Division -> reals, Pairs -> rationals & complex numbers.

Logic, Math

Algorithms are sequence (dependency in time order), concurrent (non-interfering, simultaneous), branch (different Universes)

THAT'S IT.
