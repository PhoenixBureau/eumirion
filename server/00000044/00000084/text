One of the funniest things I ever saw happened during a visit to the zoo.  There's a primate enclosure there where several chimpanzees live on a kind of an island surrounded by a dry moat and walls with thick, very large transparent plexiglass panels so visitors could watch them.

I was there watching them when I noticed a little boy who was watching them too.  I don't think he was teasing the apes but nonetheless one of them took umbrage at the little boy and expressed itself so:

The chimpanzee reached behind himself, crapped right into his own hand, and flung the result at high velocity at the kid's face and it burst against the window right where he was looking.  If not for the glass that kid would ahve had a face full of you-know-what.  He went off crying and the chimp jumped around and swung from a tree, and I laughed out loud.

I'm telling you this because we can all relate to the chimp, and I'm about to point out to you that you're in a bit of a similar situation concerning your computer software and correctness, and when I jape at you a bit I hope you won't crap in you hand and fling it.
