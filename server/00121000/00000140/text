I think it would be good to have some way to show the trace of a Joy evaluation, especially since the code to do it would be really easy.  It should be optional, but if an error occurs it should show the trace up to the exception and then the Python traceback.  These are part of the UI, most users should know what to do when they get a traceback (which, most of the time, will be to press the browser's back button and try something else.)
