Obviously the first thing to mention is George Spencer-Brown's "Laws of Form", both the book and its contents.

Next we should rewind back to Leibniz (Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz) and quickly parade forward through the history of symbolic logic, et. al.

We can then introduce the LoF notation in context, as it both caps and obviates much of what has gone before it.  (Some dispute this, it is a central tenet of the program I seek to advance.  You must decide for yourself.)
