Each page is made up of three pieces of text data, the "title", the "text", and an optional expression in the Joy language called "joy".  Together these three pieces of text comprise the whole of the data for a page.

When a page is requested the HTML for that paged is generated (and cached) from the text in the "text" text.  The title of the page is taken from the "title" text.

The rendering of the HTML never evaluates any Joy code.  The only way the "joy" text of a page can affect the HTML is by means of the /01010102/00000816 or /01010102/00000816 page actions.
