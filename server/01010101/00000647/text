While reading about Godel Machines (gotta implement extra-ASCII glyphs) I decided to implement Joy in the so-called "continuation-passing style".  This involves modifying the functions and interpreter to pass and return the expression under evaluation as well as the stack.  This permits any function to rewrite the expression, in effect changing the future expression ("continuation") that is about to be evaluated.

Doing this, each combinator must be defined as a transformation of the expression into a form that will carry on with the evaluation.

The i combinator is easy:

... [Q] i == ... Q
cssclass:/12345678/12415686

The implementation of i just puts the terms in the quoted expression Q into the to-be-executed expression in the proper order and returns that along with the unmodified stack to the main joy() interpreter loop.

Now that we have i we can define the dip combinator in terms of it:

... n [Q] dip == ... [Q] i n
cssclass:/12345678/12415686

Normally this form would be impossible because dip would not be able to "pull" the n term out of the stack and into the expression after i, but now it is no problem.

Let's consider the ifte combinator:

... [if] [then] [else] ifte  cssclass:/12345678/12395686

We can approximate the structure of the transformed expression as:

[futures] select run
cssclass:/12345678/12395686

Where futures is a pair of quoted programs each of which is one of the two possible future computations the ifte combinator might evaluate:

futures == [else-future] [then-future]
cssclass:/12345678/12415686

else-future == [...] unstack [else] i
cssclass:/12345678/12415686

then-future == [...] unstack [then] i
cssclass:/12345678/12415686

select is a program to select one of the futures based on the test program

select == [...] [if] infra first truthy getitem
cssclass:/12345678/12415686

and run evaluates that selected future computation.

run == i
cssclass:/12345678/12415686

Putting it all together:

[[[...] unstack [else] i] [[...] unstack [then] i]] [...] [if] infra first truthy getitem i
cssclass:/12345678/12395686


The while combinator has a similar form:

... [test] [body] while
cssclass:/12345678/12395686

We can reuse the structure of ifte transformed expression:

[futures] select run
cssclass:/12345678/12395686

futures == [else-future] [then-future]
cssclass:/12345678/12415686

If the test fails, do nothing:

else-future == [...] unstack
cssclass:/12345678/12415686

But if the test succeeds:

then-future == [...] unstack [body] i [test] [body] while
cssclass:/12345678/12415686

select and run are as for ifte.

Putting it all together:

[[[...] unstack] [[...] unstack [body] i [test] [body] while]] [...] [test] infra first truthy getitem i
cssclass:/12345678/12395686

The infra combinator is defined easily in terms of dip and a combinator swaack (which swaps the stack with a quoted list, see below.)

... [n] [Q] infra == ... [n Q]
cssclass:/12345678/12415686

... [n] [Q] infra == ... [n] swaack [Q] dip swaack
cssclass:/12345678/12415686


The "swaack" combinator just swaps the stack with a quoted stack.

 ... [n] swaack == n [...]
cssclass:/12345678/12415686

css:/12345678/00000008
css:/12345678/01010102
