Most kinds of enhancement will take the form of adding new Joy primitives and definitions to the system.

I envision a periodic "mass refactoring" where the most useful commands and definitions are converted into new definitions and built-in functions. This process must also have a meta-process that gives feedback to improve the improvement.

There will also be a rich and fun area of exploration around implementing compilers and interpreters for Joy.

Writing new command pages is considered part of the normal usage of the server.
