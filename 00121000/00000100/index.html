I do expect to write more page actions, and eventually I'll probably have to buckle and allow e.g. js: actions to load client-side behavior.</p><p><h2>Joy Development</h2><p>Most kinds of enhancement will take the form of adding new Joy primitives and definitions to the system.</p><p>I envision a periodic "mass refactoring" where the most useful commands and definitions are converted into new definitions and built-in functions. This process must also have a meta-process that gives feedback to improve the improvement.</p><p>There will also be a rich and fun area of exploration around implementing compilers and interpreters for Joy.</p><p>Writing new command pages is considered part of the normal usage of the server.</p></p><p><h2>SVG Content</h2>I want to add an SVG interface and D3 (or something that works like it)</p><p><h2>Display the Python Source of the Server</h2>I'd like to be able to at least display, if not edit, the Python source of the underlying system, with syntax highlighting.  (There is a "recipe" from ActiveState's cookbook site written by Hettinger for generating HTML with color syntax highlighting from Python code in eumi/utilities/recipe-578178-1.py.)</p><p><h2>Trace Joy Evaluation</h2>I think it would be good to have some way to show the trace of a Joy evaluation, especially since the code to do it would be really easy.  It should be optional, but if an error occurs it should show the trace up to the exception and then the Python traceback.  These are part of the UI, most users should know what to do when they get a traceback (which, most of the time, will be to press the browser's back button and try something else.)</p><p><h2>Interaction with Git</h2>Since we are storing history in git it makes sense to provide some sort of interface to it.  Linking to past versions of pages is one thing that leaps out.  Permitting the user to visit past versions of the server and either proceed from there (saved games) or cherry pick page data from the past into the current server.  (More generally there should be ways to build up new servers from data from other servers, whether those are completely different or just past versions of the "target" server.)</p><p></p></div><hr><form action="/00121000/00000100" method="POST"><h4>Edit</h4><label for="title">Title:</label><input name="title" placeholder="You can use the editor below to write some text..." size="44" type="text" value="Ideas for Enhancing the Server"><br><label for="text">Text:</label><br><textarea cols="58" name="text" placeholder="Write something..." rows="15">The actual server code should need relatively little change.
